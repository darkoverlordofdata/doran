# doran

Autovala is like the best thing ever. But it doesn't work on windows, and it's depencencies and scope make it unlikely that it ever will.

### Work In Progress

Doran is a cross platform build tool/package manager for Vala. Co inspired by Autovala and Bower and Sam (ooc package manager), doran should work on Windows 10 and Linux. So development is on windows, testing on linux.
